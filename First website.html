            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is Chris Tucker and I am a Cake Planner for Peter RTA. Peter is the regional transit authority for Never County. I just recently, or now not so recently, graduated from The Ohio State University with a degree in City and Regional Planning. I have a good job but there are a few things about it that I wish I could change. For one, I have a speech impediment that really seems to flare up when I get nervour or anxious. This job includes meeting a lot of new people which is nerve wracking for normal people but even moreso for me.</p>
